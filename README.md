# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
An election commission in Colorado has tasked me with performing an audit on their local election in order to determine the winner as well as analyze the outcomes by county. They requested the following information:
<br/>
* Calculate total number of votes
* Get a complete list of candidates who received votes
* Calculate the total number of vates each candidate won
* Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout
<!-- end of the list -->
In order to find these values, I used Python 3 to read the election data and perform my analysis. 
<br/>

## Election-Audit Summary 
<br/>
The script I used to perform the audit on this election is easy to use and modify. I recommend using it in future elections as it eases the process of calculating results.
